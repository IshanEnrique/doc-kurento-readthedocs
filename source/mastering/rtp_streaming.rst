RTP Streaming
%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Besides WebRTC connections, Kurento Media Server is able to manage standard RTP
streams, allowing to connect an instance of KMS to a wide variety of devides.

There are two things to note when dealing with RTP connections, regarding the
automatic congestion control algorithms that KMS implements, and the NAT
traversal capabilities.


Congestion Control (REMB)
=========================

Prior to version 6.7.0, only WebRTC connections made use of this mechanism,
which allows to reduce the sender video bitrate in situations where the network
congestion doesn't allow high bitrates to be used. Now, REMB is also enabled for
basic RTP streams.

Also it is important to note that KMS implements REMB propagation between the
sender and receiver legs of a connection. This means that when KMS is used as a
proxy between a video sender and one or more vide receivers, the smallest REMB
value from the receivers will be relayed to the sender. This allows the sender
to choose a lower bitrate that will accomodate all of the receivers connected to
KMS at the other side.


Automatic port discovery (NAT traversal)
========================================

KMS is now able to automatically infer what is the public IP and port of any
remote peer which is communicating with it through an RTP connection. This
removes the need to use ICE in some specific situations, where that complicated
mechanism is not desired. This new automatic port discovery was inspired by the
Connection-Oriented Media Transport ("COMEDIA") as presented by the early Drafts
of what finally would become the RFC 4145.

**TCP-Based Media Transport in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)**
(`IETF RFC 4145 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4145>`__) defines an SDP
extension which adds TCP connections and procedures, such as how a passive
machine would wait for connections from a remote active machine and be able to
obtain connection information from the active one, upon reception of an initial
connection.

Early Drafts of RFC 4145 (up to `Draft 05 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-comedia-05>`__)
also contemplated the usage of this same concept of "Connection-Oriented Media
Transport in SDP" with UDP connections, as a way of aiding NAT traversal. This
is what has been used as a basis for the implementation of automatic port
discovery in KMS.

It works as follows:

1. The machine behind a NAT router acts as the active peer. It sends an SDP
   Offer to the other machine, the passive peer.

   A. Sending an SDP Offer from behind a NAT means that the IP and port
      specified in the SDP message are actually just the private IP and port of
      that machine, instead of the public ones. The passive peer won't be able
      to use these to communicate back to the active peer. Due to this, the SDP
      Offer states the port ``9`` (Discard port) instead of whatever port the
      active machine will be using.
   B. The SDP Offer includes the media-level attribute "a=direction:active", so
      the passive peer is able to acknowledge that the Connection-Oriented
      Media Transport is being used for that media, and it writes
      "a=direction:passive" in its SDP Answer.

2. The passive peer receives the SDP Offer and answers it as usual, with its
   public IP and port where it will be listening for incoming packets. Besides
   that, it must ignore the IP and port indicated in the received SDP Offer.
   Instead, it must enter a wait state, until the active peer starts sending
   some packets.
3. When the active peer sends the first RTP/RTCP packets to the IP and port
   specified in the SDP Answer, the passive peer will be able to analyze them on
   reception and extract the public IP and reception port of the active peer.
   3.1. The passive peer is now able to send RTP/RTCP packets to the discovered
   IP and port values of the active peer.

This mechanism has the following requisites and/or limitations:

- Only the active peer can be behind a NAT router. The passive peer must have a
  publicly accessible IP and port for RTP.
- The active peer must be able to receive RTP/RTCP packets at the same ports
  that are used to send RTP/RTCP packets. In other words, the active peer must
  be compatible with "Symmetric RTP and RTCP" as defined in
  `IETF RFC 4961 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4961>`__.
- The active peer must actually send some RTP/RTCP packets before the passive
  peer is able to send any data back. In other words, it is not possible to
  stablish a one-way stream where only the passive peer sends data to the active
  peer.

This is how to enable the Connection-Oriented Media Transport mode:

- The SDP Offer must be sent from the active peer to the passive peer.
- The IP stated in the SDP Offer can be anything (as it will be ignored), so
  "0.0.0.0" can be used.
- The Port stated in the SDP Offer should be ``9`` (Discard port).
- The active peer must include the media-level attribute "a=direction:active" in
  the SDP Offer, for each media that requires automatic port discovery.
- The passive peer must acknowledge that it supports the automatic port
  discovery mode, by including the media-level attribute "a=direction:passive"
  in the SDP Answer. As per normal rules of the SDP Offer/Answer Model (`IETF RFC 3264 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3264>`__),
  if this attribute is not present in the SDP Answer, then the active peer must
  assume that the passive peer is not compatible with this functionality and
  should react to this fact as whatever is deemed appropriate by the application
  developer.


Example
-------

This is a minimal example of the SDP Offer that a machine would send to KMS from
behind a NAT router::

    v=0
    o=- 0 0 IN IP4 0.0.0.0
    s=-
    c=IN IP4 0.0.0.0
    t=0 0
    m=audio 9 RTP/AVPF 96
    a=rtpmap:96 opus/48000/2
    a=sendonly
    a=direction:active
    a=ssrc:111111 cname:active@example.com
    m=video 9 RTP/AVPF 103
    a=rtpmap:103 H264/90000
    a=sendonly
    a=direction:active
    a=ssrc:222222 cname:active@example.com

This is what KMS would answer::

    v=0
    o=- 3696336115 3696336115 IN IP4 80.28.30.32
    s=Kurento Media Server
    c=IN IP4 80.28.30.32
    t=0 0
    m=audio 56740 RTP/AVPF 96
    a=rtpmap:96 opus/48000/2
    a=recvonly
    a=direction:passive
    a=ssrc:4061617641 cname:user885892801@host-b546a6e8
    m=video 37616 RTP/AVPF 103
    a=rtpmap:103 H264/90000
    a=recvonly
    a=direction:passive
    a=ssrc:1363449382 cname:user885892801@host-b546a6e8

In this case, KMS is installed in a server with a public IP and port; also, it
won't be sending media to the active peer, only receiving it.

Note that even in this case, KMS still needs to know on what port the sender is
listening for RTCP feedback packets, which are a mandatory part of the RTP
protocol. So, in this example, KMS will learn the public IP and port of the
active machine, and will use those to send the Receiver Report RTCP packets to
the sender.
