Usage Questions
===============

If you have questions about how to use Kurento, or have an issue that isn't related to a bug, `Stack Overflow`_ is the best place to ask. Tag questions with ``kurento`` so other folks can find them easily.

Another option you have is to contact the community through the `Kurento Public Mailing List`_, which is a medium that allows more discussion to happen around topics.

Good questions to ask would be:

- What is the best Media Pipeline to use for <place your use case here>?
- How do I check that the ICE connectivity checks are working properly for WebRTC?
- Which audio/video codec combination should I use to ensure no transcoding needs to take place?

Community Support
=================

Kurento is a community supported project, nobody is paid explicitly to offer user support. **All people answering your questions are doing it with their own time, so please be kind and provide as much information as possible.**



Bugs & Support Issues
---------------------

You can file bug reports on our `Issue Tracker`_, and they will be addressed as soon as possible.

**Support is a volunteer effort**, and there is no guaranteed response time. If you need answers quickly, you can buy commercial support as explained below.

Reporting Issues
----------------

When reporting a bug, please include as much information as possible that will help us solve this issue. Also, try to follow these guidelines as closely as possible; doing so will help raising awareness of the issue:

- **Be curious**. Has it been asked before? Is it really a bug? Google is your friend!

- **Be proactive**. Check with other versions, specially with the :doc:`latest development version </user/installation_dev>`. We can't emphasize this enough: *it's the first thing that we are going to ask*.

- **Be precise**. Don't wander around your situation and go straight to the point, unless the context around it is technically required to understand what is going on. Describe as precisely as possible what you are doing and what is happening but shouldn't happen.

- **Be specific**. Explain how to reproduce the problem, being very systematic about it: step by step, so others can reproduce the bug. Also, report only *one problem per opened issue*.

If you definitely think you have hit a bug, try to include these in your bug report:

- A description of the problem (e.g. what type of abnormal effect you are seeing).
- A detailed specification of what you were executing (e.g. a specific code snippet firing the bug).
- A detailed description of the execution environment (e.g. browser, operating system, KMS version, etc).
- **A proof-of-concept is of great help**. This may need a bit of upfront work on your side to isolate the actual component that presents issues from the rest of your application logic, but it will hugely increase the chances that other members of the community or the Kurento project itself are able to reproduce your problem without needing to have your whole system in place.
- The **relevant** log generated by KMS, browser and, eventually, application server. Make sure to honor the *relevant* part: providing a 50MB log where only 10 lines are of interest is *not* providing a relevant log.
