`OpenVidu`_ is a new project from the same team that created Kurento. It acts as a wrapper around an installation of Kurento Media Server and encapsulates most of its features, in order to greatly simplify some of the most typical use cases of WebRTC -such as conference rooms-.

An application developer using OpenVidu doesn't need to worry about all the low-level technologies and protocols that form part of typical WebRTC communications. The main goal of this project is to provide a simple, effective, easy-to-use API; just include the OpenVidu client-side and OpenVidu Server for handling the media flows, and you'll have a full-featured WebRTC-capable application.

For more advanced needs, or for applications that require more versatile management of media processing pipelines, Kurento is still the go-to solution; however, if you are planning on building a service which matches one of the simplified use cases covered by OpenVidu, we strongly suggest to check it out as it will be easier and cheaper to go that route.
